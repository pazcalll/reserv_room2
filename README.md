Based on campus major problem, I created an application to borrow a room for department educational purposes. Because oftenly, the admin is not in his/her place to be asked for a room key. This app can change admin's job to lend a key to the students, lecturers, or those who need a room in department building for their events. It uses a QRcode as the room authentication to make those who wants to borrow the room can get the room faster by scanning it right in front of the room itself.

the database is saved as borrow_room.sql in this repository.
